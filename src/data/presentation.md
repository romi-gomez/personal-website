With over 9 years of experience as a designer, frontend developer, and multimedia artist, I create digital experiences that blend art and technology into user-centric solutions.  

Proficient with tools like Figma and Adobe Creative Suite, and javascript frontend frameworks. My foundation in product design prioritizes user needs, enhancing usability. Balancing aesthetics with functionality and creating intuitive solutions.  

As a bridge between development and UX teams, I've integrated design processes with agile methodologies, enhancing efficiency and fostering innovation. Understanding backend and frontend technologies enriches my designs, ensuring they are visually appealing and technically sound.   

Having worked across diverse industries such as tourism, architecture, real estate, e-commerce, art, and wellness, I bring a holistic approach to digital product development. Iâ€™m enthusiastic about applying my multidisciplinary background to new challenges and opportunities.
